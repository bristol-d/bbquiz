# Bristol Blackboard Quiz Maker

This project lets you write your blackboard quizzes in a text-based format instead of using the clunky user interface in blackboard. You can compile quiz files to ZIP packages that you can upload to blackboard, as well as create HTML overview files that you can use for example to show to your external examiner or other quality control people. The main features are:

  * A text-based format for quizzes.
  * Write your questions in markdown for emphasis, lists, paragraphs etc.
  * Embed TeX formulas in your quizzes that are rendered as PNG images.
  * Rendered images are cached across runs to speed up the common use case where you repeatedly proofread, edit and recompile your quiz.

Special thanks to:

  - @toastedcrumpets for originally figuring out how to create blackboard ZIP format files with embedded image resources (this project started as a fork of their [BlackboardQuizMaker](https://github.com/toastedcrumpets/BlackboardQuizMaker)).
  - @arranstewart for helping with packaging this project up so you can install it with `pip`.

The project is released under the MIT licence.

## Installation

```
$ python3 -m pip install https://github.com/bristol-d/bbquiz/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
```

Or, using `git` to fetch a full copy of the repository:

- `git clone` this repository, `cd` in, and run `pip install .`.

## Usage

This project reads a source file in a text-based format and produces a ZIP file of questions that can be uploaded to blackboard. To run it, run

```
$ bbquiz SOURCEFILE
```

This creates both a ZIP file, which you can upload to blackboard, and a
HTML file with an overview of your questions. The names of the output
files are taken from the `.filename` command in your source file, which
also functions as the blackboard package name.

For example, create a file named `myquestions.txt` with the following
contents:

```
.filename MyQuestions

.pool Mock Exam

  .question mcq
    .text What is the capital of Switzerland?
    .option Zurich
    .answer Bern
    .option Geneva

.pool Real Exam

  .question maq
      .text Which of the following are in Switzerland?
      .option Paris
      .answer Geneva
      .answer Lausanne
      .option Nancy
```

Running `bbquiz ./myquestions.txt` will create:

- A file `MyQuestions.html`, containing an HTML preview of your
  questions
- A file `MyQuestions.zip`, which can be imported into Blackboard LMS.

The files will contain two "pools" of questions, each pool containing
one question.

## Dependencies

Requires Python >= 3.7.

This project is written in python and currently requires the following packages, besides system packages. You should be able to install all of them with `pip install PACKAGENAME`, even on Windows.

  * `mistletoe`, a markdown parser
  * `mako`, a template engine
  * `Pillow`, the python image library

TeX must also be installed to run the program, with both `latex` and `dvipng` on the `PATH`.

Unlike the toastedcrumpets version, this program does not need the sympy/numpy python stack installed, which means it is easier to set up with vanilla python on Windows.

## File format

Source files are in a text-based format. Each line must be exactly one of:

  * A comment, starting with the `#` character (comments last until the end of line).
  * Empty (that is, containing only whitespace), which are ignored.
  * A command (see below).
  * Part of a here-document.

Command lines are in the format `.COMMAND [ARGUMENT]`, where the optional argument either runs until the end of line, for example

    .text What is the capital of Switzerland?

or you can use a here-document to have an argument that spans multiple lines:

    .text <<END
    Consider the following cities:
      1. Zurich
      2. Bern
      3. Basel
    END

The starting indicator for a here-document is `<<` followed by a word following variable-naming conventions, with no space before the word and no further text on the same line. A here-document ends on a line containing the same word and nothing else except whitespace (so you can indent the end marker). You can reuse the same word for multiple here-documents in the same file, for example use `END` for all of them except of course if you want the string END inside one of your questions.

Where a command takes a free-text argument, it is generally parsed as markdown (including the option to just write HTML directly).

A non-empty line outside of a here-document must be either a comment or a command; you cannot put a comment on the end of a command as the `#` would be interpreted as part of the command's argument. You can indent commands and comments: outside of a here-document, the first non-whitespace character (`.` or `#`) determines which kind of line it is. Any other starting character is an error.

## Commands

The first command in a source file must be `.filename NAME` where `NAME` follows variable naming conventions (alphanumeric and underscores). This is used both for the name of the ZIP file to output and for the name of the package object that will be created in blackboard.

A package contains pools, and pools contain questions. You start a new pool with `.pool NAME` where the name can be anything that is safe to use in a HTML/XML tag value (e.g. spaces are ok, but double quotes are not). So the general format of the file is:

    .filename MyQuestions

    .pool Mock Exam
      .question mcq
        # mock question 1 details
      .question mcq
        # mock question 2 details
        # ...

    .pool Real Exam
      .question mcq
        # real question 1 details
        # ...

The argument to a `.question` command is the question type. If you give a question with no type, then `mcq` is assumed.

Parsing of a question ends when another `.question`, `.template` or `.pool` is encountered, or at the end of the file.

Just after a `.pool` but before the first `.question` in the pool, you may include an `.instructions` command. Its argument is text (including markdown, HTML and TeX) that is displayed to students at the top of the exam page, above the questions, under the heading _Instructions:_. You could use this, for example, for information like this if appropriate:

    .instructions <<END
    Every question in this part of the exam is worth 3 marks
    and has exactly one right answer.

    You get 3 marks for selecting the right answer and 0 marks
    for selecting an incorrect answer or no answer at all.
    END

## Configuration commands

After `.filename`, which must be the first command, but before starting the first pool, you may optionally include any of the following commands:

  * `.html ARG` inserts the argument into the HTML file for output. Used together with a here-document, you can use this to create a custom stylesheet for example, or to include extra content describing your file. You can use markdown and HTML in the argument. This information is not displayed to students.
  * `.preamble ARG` declares a custom preamble for TeX, which goes between the `documentclass` and `begin{document}` lines. This allows you to add custom packages or declare macros.
    If you do not use the preamble command, then by default `amsfonts` and `amsmath` are included; if you do set a preamble and want to continue to use these two packages then you need to declare them in your preamble again.
  * `.config KEY=VALUE` sets a global configuration option. Currently the following are supported:
    - `qn_width` (integer value): Zero-pad question numbers, for example with `qn_width=2` the questions are numbered Q01, Q02 etc. instead of Q1, Q2 etc. This is useful because when you import questions into blackboard, it displays question "numbers" (which are really strings) in lexicographic order.
    - `qidtags`: setting this to `true` creates a random ID for each question and inserts it as an invisible `<div>` at the start of the question; although it is invisible to students, it does appear when you download the CSV results of the exam so you can use it to get an accurate list of who answered which questions, if you are using random blocks.
    - `keep_imagenames`: setting this to `true` maintains the filenames of the PNG files added to the compiled ZIP package. Setting this to `false` (or omitting this configuration command) results in obfuscated image filenames in the final exam - useful if the source filenames give a clue to the correct answer for a question !

## Question configuration

All question types support the following commands, which must come immediately after `.question` and before any question-specific commands:

  * `.note` writes its argument to the HTML file output, but is not shown to students. You could use this for example for more detailed notes on the sample solution.
  * `.config key=value` sets a configuration option. All question types support the following generic configuration keys, but different types of question may support further options:
    - `points` sets the number of points for this question. If omitted, the default is 10. The value must be an integer.

## Question types

### Multiple choice (mcq)

    .question mcq
      .text What is the capital of Switzerland?
      .option Zurich
      .answer Bern
      .option Geneva

Multiple choice questions have exactly one right answer. They take a mandatory `.text` with the question stem, then a list of options where incorrect options are given with `.option` and the correct one with `.answer`. The stem and the options (both correct and incorrect) are parsed as markdown, and you can use here-documents to make them span more than one line.

It is an error to have a number of `.answer` commands for a question other than one. Blackboard seems to support multiple choice questions with up to 100 options (including the correct one).

You can use markdown and Tex in both the text and the option/answer commands' arguments.

### Multiple answer (maq)

    .question maq
        .text Which of the following are in Switzerland?
        .option Paris
        .answer Geneva
        .answer Lausanne
        .option Nancy

A multiple answer question is syntactically exactly like a multiple choice question, except that there can be any number of correct answers including zero. Students must select all that apply and blackboard's automarker will give full marks if all choices are correct (the student has selected all of the correct options and none of the incorrect ones) and no marks otherwise.

It should be possible to implement more complex scoring rules as blackboard's internal XML format uses tags with arbitrary and/or/not combinations, but this is not implemented in this tool yet.

### Multiple answer with dropdown (multi)

This is a shorthand for implementing a multiple answer question using blackboard's "jumbled sentence" question type, where students have to pick an answer for each subquestion using a dropdown with values such as true/false. It allows for proper partial marking.

    .question multi
    .text <<END
    Mark the following as True or False:
      - Cheddar is produced in France. {2}
      - Cheddar is a type of cheese. {1}
    END

Insert a `{1}` resp. `{2}` where you want a dropdown box to appear, and use 1 for true/correct/yes and 2 for false/incorrect/no.

By default, the options in each box are `True` and `False`, but you can use the option
`.config display=KEYWORD` to change the values. Allowed values for the keyword are `True`, `Yes` and `Correct`, and the same values with the first letter not capitalised if you prefer that. The corresponding keyword for the negative option is then chosen accordingly.

In blackboard itself, these questions will show up as "jumbled sentence" rather than "multiple answer".

### Short answer

```
.question shortanswer
    .text What is the capital of Switzerland?
```

A short-answer question simply contains a text (that can include markdown/HTML/Tex) and displays a rich-text box for students to answer. It cannot be automatically marked, but you can mark it manually in the blackboard grade centre.

### Long answer (essay)

```
.question longanswer
    .text Write an essay on the Swiss political system.
```

Essay questions seem functionally identical to short answer questions, they also display a rich text box for students to answer in.

### Numeric

    .question numeric
        .text What is the square root of 2?
        .answer 1.414 delta 0.01

A numeric question requires a 'text' and an 'answer' command, in that order. The text can be markdown/HTML/Tex as for other question types. The answer is either a number (in which case the student must give that exact answer to get points) or "NUMBER delta NUMBER" to specify a range, for example "1.414 delta 0.01" accepts answers in the range from 1.404 to 1.424.

Numbers can be:
  - An integer, with an optional leading minus sign.
  - A floating point value, with an optional leading minus sign, where at least one digit before the decimal point is required (so 0.2 is ok but .2 is not).

Exponential notation (1.0e2) is currently not supported.

### Jumbled Sentence

    .question jumbled
        .text Complete the poem: The {2} {3} on the {1}.
        .option mat
        .option cat
        .option sat
        .option pat
        .option fat

A jumbled sentence question takes a HTML/markdown text and a list of options. The option values must be plain text, not HTML, as they end up in a dropdown box.

In the text, you can write placeholders with the syntax `{n}` where `n` is the number of the correct option in the list - counting starts at one, not zero.

_Note: internally, blackboard uses the syntax `[tag]` to denote placeholders, so you must not use square brackets in your question text itself._

_If you let the student see a summary of all the questions and points, but not the answers, at the end of the test then this question would be shown as `Complete the poem: the [a] [b] on the [c].` using tags that are simply consecutive letter sequences, so this does not give the answer away. The only reason that the answer information is encoded in the question text itself for this question type is to make the input file format a bit easier._

The normal scoring method for this kind of question is full marks for getting every choice right and 0 marks otherwise. You can change this by adding the line `.config partial=true` after the `.question` line but before the `.text` one, in which case each box in which the student selects an answer gives 1/N of the total marks for the question if correct, and 0 marks otherwise, where N is the total number of option boxes in the question.

### Fill in the blanks

    .question blanks
        .text Complete the poem: The {} sat on the {}.
        .answer cat
        .answer mat

A fill-in-the-blanks question takes a text with one or more `{}` placeholders, which get displayed to the student as text boxes. You must provide the same number of `.answer` lines, each taking a plain text argument.

_Internally, blackboard uses placeholders of the form `[a], [b], ...`. You must not use anything in the question text that renders to something looking like a blackboard placeholder. Markdown links are fine because these get turned into HTML before they reach blackboard._

Currently, the scoring system implemented is full marks for an exact match everywhere, 0 marks otherwise - partial marks are on the TODO list.

## Markdown, HTML and Tex

In most places where a command's argument is text that will end up being displayed in blackboard, you can use markdown as understood by the [mistletoe](https://github.com/miyuchina/mistletoe) parser - it complies with the CommonMark standard so anything defined in that standard should work. You can also include raw HTML, as long as blackboard is happy with it.

Note that markdown's indentation rules apply, for example anything indented four or more spaces is generally a code block. For example:

```
.question mcq
    # This will not do what you want, as the indentation creates a code block:
    .text <<END
    What is the **capital** of Switzerland?
    END

.question mcq
    # This is the correct way to do it, even though it spoils indentation
    # of the source file. Indentation of the END marker does not matter
    # as markdown never sees it.
    .text <<END
What is the **capital** of Switzerland?
    END    
```

On top of this, we have implemented inline Tex by defining the following new span tokens:

  * `$...$` typesets its contents as a Tex formula, similar to using the same syntax in Tex.
  * `$$...$$` typesets its contents as Tex _display math_ - to be precise it wraps it in an `align*` block.
  * `$$$...$$$` typesets its contents as raw Tex, e.g. in paragraph mode.

In all cases, the content (with suitable delimiters) is piped through Tex and the result is put in a PNG image, which is then embedded in the ZIP file for upload.

We call `latex`, not `pdflatex`, as the pipeline is currently `latex` for `tex -> dvi` then `dvipng` for `dvi -> png`. This produces slightly higher quality images than going through `pdflatex`, which would (anti)aliasing artifacts especially for tiny fonts such as exponents and subscripts. However, this means that packages which rely on the pdf driver such as `tikz/pgf` will currently not work.

The way the Tex token is implemented means that you are subject to the markdown parser's rules for span tokens, for example this works to create an unordered list whose elements are Tex formulas:

```
.question mcq
.text <<END
Consider the following polynomials:
  * $(x-1)(x-2)$
  * $(x-1)(x-3)$
END
```

But this does not, because markdown inline tags are not recognised in lines starting with raw HTML tags:

```
# Do not do this, it doesn't work
.question mcq
.text <<END
Consider the following polynomials:
<ul>
  <li>$(x-1)(x-2)$</li>
  <li>$(x-1)(x-3)$</li>
</ul>
END
```

Your Tex code can span several lines, but not markdown paragraphs - in other words, you cannot have empty lines inside your Tex code. For example:

```
.question mcq
# this works
.text <<END
Consider the formula
$
\left(
  \sum_{i=0}^N i
\right)
=
\frac{N(N+1)}{2}
$
END
```

This puts the formula inline in the rendered output, so you get "Consider the formula ..." all on one line. If you want the formula to stand on its own, include an empty line _before_ the first `$` sign. This causes a paragraph break in markdown (same rule as in Tex' paragraph mode), and as long as there are no empty lines between the opening and closing `$` sign, the formula will become a paragraph of its own in the output.

TeX is by default compiled as follows:

    \documentclass[varwidth]{standalone} % makes the bounding box exactly as big as it needs to be
    % START PREAMBLE
    \usepackage{amsmath}
    \usepackage{amsfonts}
    % END PREAMBLE
    \begin{document}
    % YOUR TEXT HERE
    \end{document}

The code you write in the `$ ... $` tag is inserted in the _your text here_ line, with the appropriate delimiters (single `$` becomes `$`, double `$` becomes `\begin{align*}...\end{align*}`, triple `$` produces no extra delimiters at all). If you wish, before the first pool you can use the `.preamble` command to declare a custom preamble which replaces the lines from _start preamble_ to _end preamble_, for example to declare your own macros or include further packages. Note that this replaces, not extends, the default one so you have to redeclare amsmath/amsfonts in your own preamble if you want to use them.

The TeX cache maintained by this program stores images based on the hash of the entire document sent to TeX, so you can edit your preamble as you like and you do not have to worry about an old version of a cached file being included by accident.

## Templates

Sometimes, it is useful to generate questions from a template, e.g. to make different versions of the same question with different numbers. We support this through the following syntax:

    .template N SEPARATOR
        code
    SEPARATOR
        text
    SEPARATOR

For example,

    .template 3 ENDTEMPLATE
        import random
        a = random.randint(10, 20)
        b = random.randint(10, 20)
    ENDTEMPLATE
        .question numeric
        .text What is {a} + {b}?
        .answer {a + b}
    ENDTEMPLATE

The templating system works as follows.

  1. Everything up to the first line containing the separator (and nothing else) is parsed and written into a temporary python file. If the first line of code is indented with spaces, then this number of leading spaces is stripped from all lines in the block.
  2. The same for everything up to the second instance of the separator, with the same rule for indentation. This is then appended to the temporary file as an f-string, e.g. `print(f"""...""")`.
  3. The temporary file is executed N times (as a subprocess, so it cannot interact with the parser directly), and its standard output is parsed as if it were part of the source file.

Template questions, together with random blocks in blackboard, can thus be used to create questions of the same style but with different numbers for different students. This randomisation happens at the bbquiz level - to blackboard, the result is N independent questions. Blackboard's own features for question randomisation are not used here.

You need to respect the following python rules for this to work.

  * All the rules for [f-strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) apply to the question block, e.g. `{x}` interpolates the value of the local variable `x`, if you want an opening or a closing curly brace then you need to double it (e.g. to make a group in a TeX string).
  * Since the f-string is triple-double-quoted, you should not use triple double quotes in the question block.
  * You should not write anything to standard output in the code block unless you want it to appear in the text that is parsed to create the question. If you want to however, you can leave the question text empty by putting the separator twice in a row on successive lines, and use print statements in your code block to generate the question yourself.

The number of the current run (starting at 0, going up to N-1 inclusive) is passed to your script as a command-line parameter. This lets you do the following for example, to generate versions of a question from an array:

    .template 3 ENDTEMPLATE
        import sys
        animals = [
          ("mouse", "mice"),
          ("sheep", "sheep"),
          ("goose", "geese")
        ]
        index = sys.argv[1]
        singular, plural = animals[int(index)]
    ENDTEMPLATE
        .question blanks
        .text What is the plural of {singular}? {{}}
        .answer {plural}
    ENDTEMPLATE

Note that `{{}}` in an f-string becomes `{}` in the question itself, which is what the "blanks" type question needs as a placeholder.
